- Twins_v100.ino  Start version for Serial communication between 2 of NodeMCU 1.0
                  -- Twin Pin  D7==RX   D8==TX
- Twins_v110.ino  Must use with double OLED 0.96 screen for both debug by Serial_OLED
                  -- OLED Pin  D2==SCL  D3==SDA
                  -- C-Connected recheck pair
                  -- D-Connected double-check pair
                  -- EEPROM 0 to 5 Twin-S start parity
                  -- EEPROM 6 to 11 Twin-S check Twin parity
- Twins_v120.ino  Start communicate with EEPROM data 
                  -- EEPROM address 12 is parity D-Connected double check address
                  -- EEPROM address >12 are zinc data to both of Twin
